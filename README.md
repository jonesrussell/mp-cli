# MP CLI

This is a powerful command-line tool to interact with the MP Emailer web application, combining the best features of Laravel's Artisan and Drupal's Drush.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or later
- Cobra CLI framework

## Features and Design Principles

1. Deep Framework Integration:
   - Tightly integrate the CLI tool with our Golang web framework.
   - Ensure the tool can access all core services and components of the framework.

2. Extensible Command Structure:
   - Use a clear, namespaced command structure (e.g., `make:controller`).
   - Allow for easy addition of custom commands by developers.

3. Code Generation and Scaffolding:
   - Implement robust code generation for controllers, models, middleware, etc.
   - Include commands for scaffolding entire features or modules.

4. Database Management:
   - Provide commands for migrations, seeding, and schema management.
   - Include utilities for database backup, restore, and synchronization between environments.

5. Configuration Management:
   - Implement commands to manage framework configuration, including import/export capabilities.

6. Multi-environment Support:
   - Design the tool to work across different environments (development, staging, production).
   - Include support for environment-specific configurations.

7. Remote Execution:
   - Implement functionality to run commands on remote instances of the application.

8. Plugin System:
   - Create a plugin architecture for third-party packages to add or extend commands.

9. Performance Optimization:
   - Ensure fast bootstrap times for quick execution of simple commands.
   - Implement lazy loading of resources for more complex operations.

10. Comprehensive Documentation:
    - Provide detailed, auto-generated help for each command.
    - Include examples and best practices in the documentation.

11. Testing Support:
    - Include commands for running tests, generating test scaffolds, and managing test databases.

12. Asset Management:
    - Implement commands for compiling, minifying, and managing frontend assets.

13. Caching Utilities:
    - Provide commands for managing various caching layers in the application.

14. Logging and Debugging:
    - Include utilities for viewing and managing application logs.
    - Implement debugging helpers for development environments.

15. Service Management:
    - Create commands for starting, stopping, and restarting various services.

16. Interactive Shell:
    - Implement an interactive shell for exploring and manipulating the application's state.

17. Dependency Management:
    - Integrate with Go modules for managing dependencies.
    - Provide commands for adding, updating, and removing dependencies.

18. Internationalization Support:
    - Include utilities for managing translations and localization files.

19. Security Utilities:
    - Implement commands for security-related tasks like generating secure keys, hashing passwords, etc.

20. Performance Profiling:
    - Add commands for profiling application performance and generating reports.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jonesrussell/mp-cli.git`
2. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
3. Run the application: `go run main.go`

## Usage

Run `go run main.go help` to see a list of available commands.

## Implementation Approach

1. Use Cobra as the foundation for our CLI tool.
2. Implement a plugin system for easy extension of capabilities.
3. Use Go's reflection for auto-discovery and registration of commands.
4. Leverage Go's concurrency features for performance-intensive tasks.
5. Implement a flexible, extensible configuration system.
6. Use interfaces for easy mocking and testing of CLI components.

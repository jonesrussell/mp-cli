Excellent goal! To create a CLI tool for your new Golang web framework that combines the best aspects of both Artisan and Drush, you can focus on the following key features and design principles:

1. Deep Framework Integration:
   - Tightly integrate your CLI tool with your Golang web framework, similar to how Artisan works with Laravel.
   - Ensure the tool can access all core services and components of your framework.

2. Extensible Command Structure:
   - Use a clear, namespaced command structure like Artisan (e.g., `make:controller`).
   - Allow for easy addition of custom commands by developers.

3. Code Generation and Scaffolding:
   - Implement robust code generation capabilities for creating controllers, models, middleware, etc.
   - Include commands for scaffolding entire features or modules.

4. Database Management:
   - Provide commands for database migrations, seeding, and schema management.
   - Include utilities for database backup, restore, and synchronization between environments (inspired by Drush).

5. Configuration Management:
   - Implement commands to manage your framework's configuration, including import/export capabilities.

6. Multi-environment Support:
   - Design the tool to work seamlessly across different environments (development, staging, production).
   - Include support for environment-specific configurations.

7. Remote Execution:
   - Implement functionality to run commands on remote instances of your application, similar to Drush's site aliases.

8. Plugin System:
   - Create a plugin architecture that allows third-party packages to easily add new commands or extend existing ones.

9. Performance Optimization:
   - Ensure fast bootstrap times for quick execution of simple commands.
   - Implement lazy loading of resources for more complex operations.

10. Comprehensive Documentation:
    - Provide detailed, auto-generated help for each command.
    - Include examples and best practices in the documentation.

11. Testing Support:
    - Include commands for running tests, generating test scaffolds, and managing test databases.

12. Asset Management:
    - Implement commands for compiling, minifying, and managing frontend assets.

13. Caching Utilities:
    - Provide commands for managing various caching layers in your application.

14. Logging and Debugging:
    - Include utilities for viewing and managing application logs.
    - Implement debugging helpers for development environments.

15. Service Management:
    - Create commands for starting, stopping, and restarting various services your framework might use (e.g., web server, worker processes).

16. Interactive Shell:
    - Implement an interactive shell (like Laravel's Tinker) for exploring and manipulating your application's state.

17. Dependency Management:
    - Integrate with Go modules for managing dependencies.
    - Provide commands for adding, updating, and removing dependencies.

18. Internationalization Support:
    - Include utilities for managing translations and localization files.

19. Security Utilities:
    - Implement commands for security-related tasks like generating secure keys, hashing passwords, etc.

20. Performance Profiling:
    - Add commands for profiling application performance and generating reports.

Implementation Approach:

1. Use a robust CLI library like [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) or [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) as the foundation for your tool.
2. Implement a plugin system that allows for easy extension of the tool's capabilities.
3. Use Go's reflection capabilities to auto-discover and register commands from your framework and plugins.
4. Leverage Go's concurrency features for performance-intensive tasks.
5. Implement a flexible configuration system that can be easily extended.
6. Use interfaces extensively to allow for easy mocking and testing of your CLI tool's components.

By combining these features and following these principles, you can create a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly CLI tool that enhances developer productivity and simplifies management tasks for your Golang web framework, incorporating the strengths of both Artisan and Drush.
